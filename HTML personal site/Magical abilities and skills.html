  <h2>Magical abilities and skills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><label for=""  ><strong>Flying:</strong></label>
      Regulus played as Seeker for the Slytherin Quidditch team during his time at Hogwarts,<br>
      meaning he was a highly accomplished and skilled broomstick flyer and very gifted at Quidditch,<br>
      or at least so in his youth.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><label for=""><strong>Dark Arts:</strong> </label>
      Being a former Death Eater, Regulus would have been proficient and accomplished with dark magic.<br>
      Regulus also had excellent and esoteric knowledge of highly advanced dark magic,<br>
      as he was intelligent and knowledgeable enough to know what Horcruxes are,<br>
      dark arts of the highest levels that only very few would ever know, <br>
      and even deduced that Voldemort made one, when no other Death Eaters knew.<br>
      He also managed to slip past the defences that Voldemort placed on the locket and<br>
      managed to retrieve it in the Cave, though at the cost of his own life at the hands of <br>
      Voldemort's Inferi in the cave's waters.
