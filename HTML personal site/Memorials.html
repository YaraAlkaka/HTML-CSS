    <li><em>"He was murdered by Voldemort. Or on Voldemort's orders, more likely. I doubt <br>
        Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. <br>
        From what I found out after he died, he got in so far, <br>
        then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out. <br>
        Well, you don't just hand in your resignation to Voldemort. It's a lifetime of service or death.<br></em>
      — Sirius Black's version of Regulus's death."

    <br>
    <li><em>"Fight, fight for my master, the defender of the House elves.<br>
        Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!"<br></em>
      — Kreacher urging the house-elves of Hogwarts to fight in the name of Regulus and Harry Potter.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><em>"Regulus was instantly recognisable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row.<br>
        He had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, <br>
        slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been."<br></em>
      — Description of Regulus.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><em>"For years he talked of the Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of<br>
        hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle-borns... and when he was sixteen years old, <br>
        Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord."<br></em>
      — Kreacher remembering Regulus.
