  <h2>Story Line</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>From a young age, Regulus admired Lord Voldemort and had an ambition <br>
      to become a Death Eater later on in his life.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Regulus had photos and articles about the Dark Lord and his followers<br>
      cut from the Daily Prophet, which were hung in his bedroom near a painting of his family crest.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Regulus received his Dark Mark around the age of sixteen, which his family approved of as Voldemort <br>
      was seen as striving to achieve pure-blood supremacy over other wizards and Muggles.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Even though his parents were never Death Eaters themselves, they agreed with many of Lord Voldemort's <br>
      own beliefs.</li>
    <br>
    <li> After becoming a Death Eater, Regulus began to consider abandoning Lord Voldemort,<br>
      partly because his master mistreated and intended to kill the Black family's loyal house-elf Kreacher, <br>
      whilst setting up the security measures for one of his Horcruxes.</li>
  </ul>
